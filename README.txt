This is a simple key generator application that follows this algorithm:

-----------------------------
|                           |
| Valid Key = KEY * i + 467 |
|                           |
-----------------------------

"Valid Key" is a 12-digit number.
"KEY" is defined in the application.
"i" is between "F" & "L" ("F" & "L" are also defined in the application).
